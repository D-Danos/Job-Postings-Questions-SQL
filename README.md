## <b>Project Summary</b>
<b>Tools:</b> postgreSQL

In this project, I <em>utilize queries from job postings data related to coding positions to answer the following questions:</em>

1. What are the top-paying jobs for <u>data analysts</u> that can be applied from anywhere?
2. What are the skills required for these top-paying jobs for <u>data analysts</u> that can be applied from anywhere?
3. What are the most in-demand skills for <u>data analysts</u>?
4. What are the top skills based on salary for <u>data analysts</u>?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for <u>data analysts</u>? (High paying <b>and</b> high demand)

My answers are designed for flexibility, allowing you to easily modify the role and job posting location as needed. Detailed instructions are provided within the files.

<b>Note:</b> If you decide to undertake this tutorial or project, I encourage you to find <u>your own answers</u> to these questions. You may discover alternative or more efficient solutions, and it’s always beneficial to compare your results with the existing code.
